      Shinra Kusakabe is a third generation pyrokinetic youth who gained the
      nickname "Devil's Footprints" for his ability to ignite<br />
      his feet at will, and was ostracized as a child for the fire that killed
      his mother and younger brother Sho twelve years ago. <br />He joins
      Special Fire Force Company 8, which features other pyrokinetics who
      dedicated themselves to ending the Infernal attacks for<br />
      good while investigating Companies 1 through 7 for potential corruption in
      their ranks. Shinra begins to learn that the fire that killed <br />his
      mother was a cover for Sho to be taken by the White Clad, a doomsday cult
      behind the Infernal attacks with agents within the facets <br />of the
      Tokyo Empire. Company 8 and their allies oppose the White Clad while
      learning of their goal to gather eight <br />individuals like Shinra and
      Sho to repeat the Great Cataclysm for an ancient being who manipulated
      humanity for that very purpose.

    <p>
      Nanami Kento is a 1st Grade jujutsu sorcerer that works at the Tokyo
      Metropolitan Magic<br />
      Technical College. After graduating from College, Kento quit being a
      sorcerer and became a salaryman for a few<br />years before returning as a
      sorcerer after realizing it was a better option between the two career
      choices.
      <br />
      <br />
      Kento is a fairly tall man around 184 cm and is dressed like a salaryman
      <br />with a grey suit, a spotted tie, black shoes, and his signature
      arm-less sunglasses.
      <br />
      <br />
      Kento is known to be serious and reserved both in and outside of work.
      Regardless, he is a kind man who<br />
      values the lives of his companions. Seeing his work as a sorcerer is very
      appreciated by the people he helped, was what prompted<br />
      him to return as a sorcerer to help more people in the future.

    <p>
      In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate energy called Cursed Energy
      (呪力, Juryoku), which arises from negative emotions that <br />naturally
      flow throughout the body. Ordinary people cannot control this flow in
      their bodies. As a result, they continually <br />lose Cursed Energy,
      resulting in the birth of Curses (呪い, Noroi), a race of spiritual beings
      whose primary desire<br />
      is to bring harm to humanity. These Curses are shown as gruesome monsters,
      ghosts, and yōkai.
      <br />
      <br />
      Jujutsu Sorcerers (呪術師, Jujutsushi, lit. "Cursed Technique Masters" or
      "Shamans") are people who control the flow<br />
      of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they please
      and also to reduce its release. High-ranking Sorcerers<br />
      and Curses can refine this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques
      (呪術式, Jujutsushiki), which tend to be unique to the user or<br />
      their family. An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain Expansion
      (領域展開, Ryōiki Tenkai), which the users build a pocket<br />
      dimension of variable size. Inside the domain, all of their attacks will
      always connect and grow in strength.

    <p>
      The main protagonist is Mori Jin, a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul,
      South Korea.At the beginning of the story,<br />
      he is invited to join a Martial Arts tournament called "The God of High
      School" (or GOH). The event, sponsored by a shady corporation,<br />
      brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a
      regional and then, national level in order to select<br />
      three representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner
      gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.<br />
      This intrigues Mori, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets
      many competitors each with a different way of fighting.<br />Martial arts
      aside, participants fight by using "Borrowed Power", a mystical energy
      granted by supernatural entities<br />
      (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power.
      During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts
      prodigies: Full-Contact Karate expert Daewi Han and epeeist master Mira
      Yoo. These two would befriend Mori after their fights with him<br />, and
      will become teamed together as the Korean Team after the preliminary
      rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, <br />and teams
      assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and
      those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their
      goals.

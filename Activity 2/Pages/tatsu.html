    <p>
      Tatsu, an infamous and feared yakuza boss nicknamed "the Immortal Dragon",
      retires from crime to become a<br />
      househusband so that he can support Miku, his kyariaūman wife. The
      episodic series depicts a variety of comedic <br />scenarios, typically
      wherein Tatsu's banal domestic work as a househusband is juxtaposed
      against his intimidating <br />personality and appearance, and his
      frequent run-ins with former yakuza associates and rivals.

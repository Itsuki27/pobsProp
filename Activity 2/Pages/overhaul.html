    <p>
      My Hero Academia is set in a world where about 80% of the human population
      has gained superpowers called "Quirks" (個性, Kosei).<br />
      Quirks vary widely and can be inherited. Among the Quirk-enhanced
      individuals, a few of them earn the title of Heroes,<br />
      who cooperate with authorities in rescue operations and apprehending
      criminals who abuse their Quirks, commonly known as Villains.<br />In
      addition, Heroes who excel on their duties gain celebrity status and are
      recognized as "Pro Heroes" (プロヒーロー, Puro Hīrō).<br />
      Heroes are ranked in popularity, with higher ranking heroes receiving
      public appeal, although it is not uncommon for<br />
      rookie heroes to gain popularity as well.

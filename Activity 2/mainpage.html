      Kenjiro Tsuda (津田 健次郎, Tsuda Kenjirō, born June 11, 1971) is a
      Japanese actor, voice actor, and film director.<br />
      His talent agency is ANDSTIR.
      <br />
      <br />
      Tsuda lived in Jakarta until he was seven years old. He is a graduate of
      Meiji University,<br />
      where he studied theater literature in the department of literature;
      originally, he had considered wanting to make films <br />as a movie
      director, when he also had an interest in the field of performing At the
      En • Theater Research Institute<br />, he took and passed a non-degree
      course, being enthusiastic about theater work.
      <br />
      <br />
      After his graduation from a trading school, Tsuda had belonged to a
      theatre group office. In so doing, there was talk of auditions,<br />
      and Tsuda made his debut in voice acting as Atsushi Noda in the 1995
      animated television series "H2." Since then, Tsuda's work has<br />
      centered around voice acting, as he's worked in theater, television
      dramas, and movie appearances,<br />
      among others; furthermore, he has been active at many levels, including as
      a narrator and radio personality,<br />
      in television programs, commercials, and the like.
      <br />
      <br />
      Tsuda likes both filming and watching movies. He began attending movie
      theaters in junior high; though he had watched old Western movies<br />
      until senior high and focused on artistic films after entering college,
      fundamentally his interest lies, evidently, in non-genres.In 2017,
      <br />when Keiji Fujiwara was recovering from illness, Tsuda took charge
      as a substitute actor for a few roles (those of Isami Enomoto in "Space
      Battleship Yamato 2202:Warriors of Love," Hannes in "Attack on Titan").

    <p>
      Jujutsu Kaisen follows the students of a sorcery school that fight the
      terrifying demons that <br />haunt humanity. One of the most unassuming
      but terrifyingly powerful characters in the <br />anime is Nanami, a
      mature and sharp-witted sorcerer. Nanami left school to become a
      <br />businessman, having lost respect<br />
      for the jujutsu sorcery profession. He returned four years<br />
      later but retains some of his businessman traits, such as punctuality and
      a tough,no-nonsense exterior.
      <br />
      <br />
      Nanami's maturity is complemented by his irritation at Itadori's antics,
      often treating Itadori <br />as a child, since Nanami doesn't want him to
      end up jaded by sorcery like he was.

      My Hero Academia is set in a world where most people have a Quirk
      (superpower). Some<br />
      Quirks are better than others, and some people take a darker route than
      trying to become a <br />hero. An extremely powerful and intimidating
      villain with one of the strongest Quirks in the <br />show, Overhaul is a
      yakuza captain and extremely deadly, using a small child, Eri,<br />
      to manufacture Quirk-erasing drugs.
      <br />
      <br />
      Overhaul is a strategist and, at first, is level-headed, but grows more
      frantic as his villain arc reaches its<br />
      end. He abuses the child and manipulates her into compliance, but when
      faced<br />
      with stronger opposition, Overhaul resorts to fusing with another villain
      and becoming an<br />
      outright monster.

      Fire Force follows several groups of firefighters who combat the sudden
      epidemic of spontaneous<br />human combustion. Humans burst into flames
      and are turned into Infernals, which the firefighters must literally fight
      <br />to extinguish. Joker is neither a hero nor a villain, instead,
      providing information to those <br />who request it, as long as it serves
      his own needs.

    <p>
      The God of High School is the epitome of the meme, "Well, that escalated
      quickly," going from a fun tournament<br />
      between teens to a literal fight against God. Jegal Taek is one of the top
      three fighters in the series, with an<br />
      extremely violent and aggravating temperament, often picking fights with
      those on his own team.
      <br />
      <br />
      Jegal mostly fights with his Charyeok, <br />a Megaladon shark that he can
      summon to kill his enemies, but his endurance, strength, stamina, and
      speed are not to be<br />trifled with. Tsuda is a perfect choice for this
      character, as his growling, intimidating voice conveys Jegal's villainous
      intentions.
